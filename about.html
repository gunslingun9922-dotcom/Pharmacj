      <h2><u>Company History</u></h2><article>
      <p>We have been producing quality medicines for years.
        The practice of pharmacy has ancient roots dating back to the earliest civilizations, where healers and apothecaries prepared remedies from natural sources. In medieval times, pharmacists separated from physicians to become independent healthcare professionals, establishing the first apothecary shops in Europe during the 13th century. The profession evolved significantly during the Industrial Revolution with the development of synthetic drugs and standardized pharmaceutical manufacturing. Modern pharmacy emerged in the 20th century, transforming from simple drug dispensing to comprehensive medication management and patient care services. Today's pharmacists are highly trained healthcare providers who play crucial roles in disease prevention, health promotion, and ensuring safe medication use. The digital age has further revolutionized pharmacy practice with electronic prescriptions, automated dispensing systems, and telepharmacy services. As healthcare continues to advance, pharmacists remain essential partners in the healthcare team, bridging the gap between medical science and patient wellness.
